  * **Category Rows:** Projects are organized into horizontal "rows" based on technologies, project types (e.g., Full-Stack, Frontend, Backend, Mobile), or themes.
  * **Project Details Modal/Page:** Clicking on a project card reveals a detailed view with more information, live demo links, GitHub repository links, and technologies used.
  * **Search Functionality:** A search bar to quickly find projects.
  * **Responsive Design:** Optimized for various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
  * **Smooth Animations:** Engaging transitions and hover effects for a polished user experience.
